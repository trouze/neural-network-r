# Building a Neural Network from scratch in R

This project aims to implement and build a deeper level of understanding in Neural Networks. This article will profile how they learn just like the human brain does. Much of what you will see in this project is based on the first two chapters of the text by Michael Nielsen titled [Neural Networks and Deep Learning](http://neuralnetworksanddeeplearning.com/). While Nielsen builds neural network that is capable of classifying handwritten digits in Python (2.7), I'll show you how we can do it in R for a special sort of challenge.
